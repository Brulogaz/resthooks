## Python/Django

[django-rest-hooks](https://github.com/zapier/django-rest-hooks) is a complete solution that requires only a handful of configuration tasks:

1. Add `'rest_hooks'` to installed apps in settings.py.
2. Define your `HOOK_EVENTS` in settings.py.
3. Start sending hooks!

It also comes with a [live CRM demo application](http://demo.resthooks.org/) ([code available on GitHub](https://github.com/zapier/resthookdemo)). You can [read more about django-rest-hooks here](https://github.com/zapier/django-rest-hooks).


## Ruby/Rails

This [Rails library](https://github.com/net-engine/resthooks) offers a similarly simple sample application for Ruby on Rails that you can use when designing your application.


## Node.js/Sails

[This application](https://github.com/zapier/node-resthooksdemo)
provides a demonstration of using RESTHooks in conjunction with a
[Sails](http://sailsjs.org/#!)
based CRM application that leverages Waterline ORM's Lifecycle Callbacks
to notify subscriptions. You can find the relevant documentation to get
started
[here](https://github.com/zapier/node-resthooksdemo/blob/master/README.md).
