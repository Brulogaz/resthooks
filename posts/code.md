## Python/Django

With a [live CRM demo application](http://demo.resthooks.org/), the aptly named [django-rest-hooks](https://github.com/zapier/django-rest-hooks) is a complete solution that requires only a handful of configuration tasks:

1. Add `'rest_hooks'` to installed apps in settings.py.
2. Define your `HOOK_EVENTS` in settings.py.
3. Start sending hooks!

You can [read more about django-rest-hooks here](https://github.com/zapier/django-rest-hooks).


## Ruby/Rails

This [Rails library](https://github.com/net-engine/resthooks) offers a similarly easy to configure drop in application for Ruby on Rails.


## Node.js/Sails

James, you need to provide me.
