## About Zapier

Zapier enables you to automate tasks between other online services (services like Salesforce, Basecamp, Gmail, and 238 more).

Imagine capturing Wufoo form leads automatically into Salesforce or displaying new Paypal sales in your Campfire team chat room. Zapier lets you automate all these simple tasks and get back to real work.

## Case Study

Zapier is a bit unique. They integrate with other APIs instead of hosting their own. While Zapier does not formally have an API, their developer platform enables developers to add APIs to Zapier through a UI. If an API does not conform precisely to the standard Zapier expects, there is a Scripting API available which developer can use to transform requests and responses to conform.

REST Hooks are a large part of their developer platform. Instead of needing to constantly poll other APIs looking for changes, REST Hooks enable huge performance optimizations.
